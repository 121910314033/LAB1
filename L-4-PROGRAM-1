# To Implement linear search

#lenght of the list
    for i in range(len(x)):   
#comapring the elements in list with key value
        if x[i] == key:

#assigning the array
x =[10,22,36,44,57,66,79]
x = [int(y) for y in x]

#searching and calling the function..........

print(key,"was found at index",index)
print("if the index printed as none means the list dosent contains given value")


OUTPUT:

36 was found at index 2
if the index printed as none means the list dosent contains given value.
